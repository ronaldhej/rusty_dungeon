# Getting Started
- Install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to get started with rust
- Run `cargo build` to download dependencies
    - The build stage might take a while the first time as one of the dependencies is a game engine in case I want to continue making an actual game
- Run `cargo run` to run the program

## *Yes, it's really that easy. Python can [gargle my balls](https://youtu.be/67_rugfBk_Q?t=7)*
